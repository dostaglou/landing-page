        <h3>Sole Developer</h3>
        <p>Beach Bum Beverages was a 2 day crash course in developing a functional Ruby on Rails website. It offers any visitor the chance to create a cocktail with a photo of said cocktail along with detailed information on its ingredients.</p>
        <p>Over the course of about 12 hours, I designed, scripted, and launched this website. It was an early attempt to familiarize myself with the concepts of multi-model databases. While crude in terms capabilities, it reflects the early skills I developed and put into practice.</p>
